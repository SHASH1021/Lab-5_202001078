Static-Analysis
Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without
executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks, such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability,
performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the development process.

Static Analysis Tools:
Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without
executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.

How we installed the pylint tool:

Open the command prompt or Windows Terminal. You can do this by pressing the Windows key + R, then typing "cmd" and hitting Enter.

Type "pip install pylint" and hit Enter. This will download and install Pylint.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Pylint is installed by typing "pylint --version" and hitting Enter. This should display the version of Pylint you just installed.

We now use Pylint to check the quality of your Python code. To use it, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located, then type "pylint filename.py" and hit Enter. This will run Pylint on your file and provide feedback on any issues.
